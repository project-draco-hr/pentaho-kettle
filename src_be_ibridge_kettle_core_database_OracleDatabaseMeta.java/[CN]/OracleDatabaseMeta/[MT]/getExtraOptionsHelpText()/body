This is highly recommended when using the Thin driver, especially when the database character set contains four byte characters that expand to two UCS2 surrogate characters, e.g. AL32UTF8. The method defineColumnType provides no performance benefit (or any other benefit) when used with the 10.1.0 Thin driver.
